# 📚 AI-Assisted Humanities Survival Kit for STEM Students

> “This is not a rebellion against literature. It is a rebellion against wasting cognitive bandwidth on chaos.”

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This repository documents how a STEM-track student survives high school humanities courses — especially literature and history — with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT, Notion, and GitHub.

The goal: 
- To preserve cognitive energy for core subjects (math, physics, CS)
- To build structure in inherently unstructured content
- To output high-quality work *without being crushed by low-efficiency tasks*

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

In many schools, STEM students are required to write deep literary analysis, historical narratives, and reflective essays — in a foreign language, with no structured logic, under strict "no AI" rules.  
This project is a counterbalance.

We believe:
- AI tools don't destroy education — they **recover your time** and **extend your limits**.
- Using AI to clarify, summarize, and translate is not cheating — it's **accessibility**.
- Writing with AI **doesn't mean giving up thinking** — it means **thinking more clearly**.

## 🛠️ Toolkit Overview

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| 🧠 ChatGPT | Translate literary texts / Generate outline / Draft rough ideas |
| 📒 Notion | Organize research, tag quotes, create "theme maps" |
| 🧾 GitHub | Version control / Show workflow / Share polished outputs |
| 📘 Grammarly / DeepL | Language clarity + idiomatic phrasing |

## ✊ Philosophy

> “AI is not replacing the human mind — it's replacing the chaos that blocks it.”

This project does not promote blind reliance on AI.  
It promotes *smart collaboration* between human thought and machine capability — especially for students with:
- Different cognitive strengths
- Language barriers
- Limited time and energy

## 📌 For Educators

If you're a teacher, please understand:  
Students aren't cheating — they're surviving.  
What you see here is **not laziness**, it's **strategic adaptation**.

## 👤 Maintainer

Built and maintained by a STEM student who believes:
- Not all brains are wired for literary immersion
- Time is not infinite
- Efficiency is not a crime

> “I don't hate literature. I just want to live.”
