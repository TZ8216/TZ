# 🧠 Why I Use GitHub to Learn — And Why Schools Shouldn't Block It

> “When students are learning faster than teachers are willing to teach, the system needs to change.”

I’m a high school student who learned more from GitHub and ChatGPT than from school’s blocked websites and locked-down learning systems.

### ❌ What my school gets wrong

- Blocks GitHub, YouTube, ChatGPT — while pretending it’s "for our own good"
- Doesn’t trust students to use tools responsibly
- Thinks learning should be slow, manual, and teacher-controlled

### ✅ What actually helps me learn

- GitHub helps me organize, version, and *share* real knowledge
- AI tools let me simulate a mentor when none are available
- YouTube gives access to world-class lectures — *better than any textbook*

### 🙃 So what’s the problem?

It’s not about tech, it's about fear:
- Fear that students might know more
- Fear of letting go of control
- Fear of being irrelevant

### 🚀 My approach

- I build learning projects, not just cram for grades
- I self-teach APs with GitHub + Notion + AI
- I trust in efficiency, not bureaucracy

**If schools won’t change, I’ll build the system I wish I had.**
